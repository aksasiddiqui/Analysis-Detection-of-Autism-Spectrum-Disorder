# ðŸ§  Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on the **analysis and detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** using various **machine learning and deep learning algorithms**. It provides a **user-friendly GUI** built with **Tkinter** that allows users to upload datasets, preprocess data, train models, and predict ASD from new test data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload and visualize ASD datasets  
- Preprocess data with label encoding and handle missing values  
- Train and evaluate models:  
  - **Machine Learning**: SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, ANN  
  - **Deep Learning**: CNN, LSTM  
- Display metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Sensitivity, Specificity  
- Graphical visualization of performance and confusion matrix  
- Predict ASD from new, unseen data

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- Python  
- Tkinter (GUI)  
- Scikit-learn  
- Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
